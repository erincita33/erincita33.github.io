        <p> <span>We have loved having&nbsp;Erin teach our kids how to swim!!!&nbsp; We have done&nbsp;other swim lessons at&nbsp;7 Peaks and weren't happy with them.&nbsp; Erin has done wonders for our kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;She spends time individually with each one, is encouraging and positive, she makes them feel safe, but also pushes them to&nbsp;improve. &nbsp; She is exactly what we have always wanted in&nbsp;a swim teacher and the swim lesson experience.&nbsp; I recommend her to&nbsp;everyone!&nbsp; Seriously she's amazing, talented, reasonably priced...it's been an overall&nbsp;great experience!!</span><br> <br> Becca L. </p>    </div>

          <p> Please consider Erin to teach your child this fundamental and vital skill. She will work miracles with your child. It will be the best money you've ever spent. </p>
          <p> &nbsp; </p>
          <p> I have seen many kids enrolled in group lessons. I'm sure it works for some, but I feel like the kids don't get the attention they need. It seems like the kids progress much slower with group lessons. Last summer I saw the progress a friend's kids were making with private lessons, and I felt strongly that private lessons were the way to go. </p>
          <p> &nbsp; </p>
          <p> Erin is a wonderful teacher. She seamlessly teaches multiple new skills in a short amount of time, and then combines them so that your child is doing something new by the end of the lesson. This gives your child confidence and self esteem. </p>
          <p> &nbsp; </p>
          <p> She has no problem adapting to each child and uses her intuition and knowledge to personalize the lesson to your child. She has a way of teaching so that your child is having fun in the water and enjoying themself, all the while learning and growing. </p>

          <p> Erin is wonderful. M. likes her so much that she asked if she could come babysit her. Erin has also taken the time (and interest) outside of lessons to show me things I can start doing with my eight month old to get her ready to swim. </p>
          <p> M. had a fantastic first lesson and loved it. At her second lesson, she didn't even want to go in the pool. But Erin gently and patiently worked with M. until she was having fun, learning knew things, and was happy in the water. At M.'s third lesson, she swam across the warm pool--jumped off the step, put her head in, blew nose bubbles, had her arms and legs working together, and then pulled herself up out of the water--all by herself. I never imagined my daughter could progress so quickly. I don't think she ever imagined she could do it either, and she is extremely proud of herself. </p>
