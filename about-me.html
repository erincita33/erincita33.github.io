        <p> I grew up in Chico, California with a pool in my backyard and parents who took us to swimming and diving lessons every summer. &nbsp;I swam competitively in high school and after that I lifeguarded and taught lessons for 5 summers at various public pools, a preschool, and a waterpark. &nbsp;in 2008 I started my own swimming lesson business in Utah and I am now in the Bay Area. </p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p> I had my first experience teaching a private lesson at the Dwight Brinson Swim Center in Durham, California. My supervisor asked me if I wanted to take on private lessons with a 3 year old boy. The very sight of the pool brought on kicking and screaming and tears and no one knew what to do with him. I was excited to see what I could do with this little guy. </p>

    <p> My excitement didn't last long as I learned quickly that private lessons with him meant having everyone at the pool staring at me for 20 minutes day after day as I tried to figure out what to do with my little screaming banshee. But I was determined and I tried everything I could think of. By the end of the 3 weeks he was loving lessons and the very last day as he walked away holding his dad's hand he looked back at me, gave me a big grin, waved and said, "Bye, teacher!" </p>
    <p> &nbsp; </p>
    <p> I have never forgotten that cherished experience and that sweet moment. </p>
    <p> &nbsp; </p>
    <p> I went on with college, lived in Bolivia, went on a mission to Portugal, and eventually graduated from BYU with a BA in Latin American Studies. I had quite a few great job experiences in the realms of education and social work. I especially loved my time working with troubled teens in a wilderness and residential programs and with missionaries at the Missionary Training Center. My favorite moments in all those jobs was when I got to work one on one with a teen or a missionary who was struggling. Those are the moments I could see the true miracles happening. </p>

        <p> In the summer of 2007 I taught water aerobics for a woman who taught swimming in her backyard pool. I realized how much I loved and missed it and decided to start up my own business. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made! </p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p> I have loved being able to blend my swimming and swimming lesson experience with my understanding of children and people as unique and individual learners. I have taught in several swim schools and pools and I have been trained in a variety of methods. Through the years I have developed my own unique teaching style that works best for me and I have found to be most effective. </p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p> I believe in teaching people, not lessons. &nbsp;There is a difference. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;I get to know my students and I find out what motivates them and what their personal learning style is. </p>
        <p> <br> I teach all people with a focus on safety. &nbsp;Floating and buoyancy, as well as healthy respect, but not fear, of the water are the best ways to protect against accidents while in the water. &nbsp;Some swim instructors neglect these simple skills in favor of teaching competitive strokes. &nbsp;I have learned that the student's ability to learn competitive strokes is greatly heightened when buoyancy becomes natural. &nbsp;Not only does it make more sense from a safety perspective, it actually accelerates their technical progress. </p>
