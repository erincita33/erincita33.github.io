    <p>I teach children and adults at every level of experience and comfort. My students range from 6 months old to adults in all stages of life. I have come to know by experience that <strong>everybody can swim</strong>.</p>

    <p>I love teaching children with fear or special challenges. I also love teaching adults who have never learned how to swim and have a lot to conquer. For me, every student is "special needs" because I teach to their unique and individual needs and according to what works best. I am totally focused on their success and I know when to be patient and when to push for progress.</p>
